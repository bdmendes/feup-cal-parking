# feup-cal-parking

## Motivation
Solve a variant of the traveling salesman problem, in which one does not need to return to the starting point and might need to park the car near the stop points. Present a graphical animation of the driver path.

## Implementation
Cities and stop points are abstracted by graphs and respective nodes, while the edges are the roads. The data strucutres were implemented from scratch.

## Compilation
Run `cmake` at the project root.
